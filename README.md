Hello :)

Our main issue making the project work was the handling of comparing the player-cube's rotation to the "passwords" cubes. 

The selection and progression process for the player moving to the next cube works (worked*) as intended. When comparing the cubes rotation is did not always accept the correct answer as it sometimes claimed to have a different rotation than showed, for example 90 135 45 (found through printing the cubes rotation as a string) when the object's apparent rotation was 90 180 180. This happened seemingly without pattern 

So if you manage to fix this that would be awesome 

In the projects current state only 2 of the passwordcubes are randomized but the third one can easily be (just not hooked up). A lot of unused parts of the blueprints are still left as the remains of different attempts of making it work in case they would become useful to us later. Now they as just bloat as we did not delete them. Feel free to start over fully. 



Here is the game's full planned gameplay if you plan to make it a playable game:


Wether the player starts with their own cube randomized or not was not fully agreed upon so do as you like 

The password-cube's rotation should of course be random and should not be able to randomize into the same one as another, nor any of the players starting rotation. 

When the player has "confirmed" their cube to the corresponding cube in the password their colored piece (the ones around the password) moves to the next one to indicate which one they are solving

The order in which the player wins dictates the points given. 

How a player is shown as having completed the whole password was not planned in detail so have some creative liberties there

The controls can be changed so that they match the actual controller better but one idea we had about them are in the tutorial part.
